//Design and implement an application that reads an arbitrary number of integers that are in the range 0 t0 50
//inclusive and counts how many occurrences of each are entered. After all input has been processed, print all of
//the values (with the number of occurrences) that were entered one or more times.
//Extra credit: Modify the programs so that it works for numbers in the range between -25 and 25.

//step 1 make a function that takes in numbers
//step 2 make a loop that loops through each number and determines if it
